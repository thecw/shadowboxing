        We are targeting 3rd graders at Escondido School during their recess. This is a critical age where some students have become more inhibited while others have not. Two key characteristics of this age are “positive energy” and “unbounded enthusiasm”.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Setting
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Where: We would place a projection screen on the edge of the pavement in the recess area.
        </li>
        <li>
          When: During recess.
        </li>
        <li>
          How many people: We would expect around 60 third-graders, a fraction of which (maybe 10%) who might be interested in our public engagement application.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        Desired features
      </h3>
      <p>
        We would look for an application that is suitable for students with lots of energy and enthusiasm. We would also want something that can allow students to come and go and not have a fixed time required to use the application because third graders may have short attention spans.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Design features
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Fun: Many students enjoy dancing. Other public art examples have shown people like seeing themselves in another reality so our ghost shadows that play on the next repeat of a song will be a chance to see how they or their friends danced a few minutes ago. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Overcoming inhibition: We will encourage people to join in dancing and in this way create both a dance hall with real dancers and a rocking dance hall with real dancers and the ghost dancers. We also hope that the presence of ghost dancers will help users start dancing, since we have found that getting students to dance requires a critical mass of dancers dancing first.
        </li>
        <li>
          Flexible engagement time: We allow students to come and go across the screen. We avoid an atmosphere of emptiness by playing recordings of the ghost shadows.
        </li>
      </ul>

        We are targeting MIT undergrads visiting the gym who have a few key interests:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Have fun
        </li>
        <li>
          Make new friends
        </li>
        <li>
          Stay active
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The students are generally 18-22 years old and athletic.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Setting
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Where: In the main lobby of the Z Center gym since it will be warm.
        </li>
        <li>
          When: We would target users 9-11pm when it will be darker but there will be artificial lights.
        </li>
        <li>
          How many people: About 5 or so people walk by the front door per minute.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        Desired features
      </h3>
      <p>
        Students walking by the front of the gym would be inclined to use our public engagement application if it looks fun and if it’s something social (do with new or old friends).

       </h3>

        <p>         
  While brainstorming we came up with various shadowboxing application ideas related to dance, sports, augmented reality and music. We did a lot of bodystorming and sketching to elaborate more on each of the ideas and to select the most suitable application for final implementation. Music is something that everyone relates to and a Shadowboxing music application has a great potential for public engagement. People love music, moreover they love to produce music themselves, it is fun to be a creator! This was the main inspiration behind ShadowTunes. To put in simple words, ShadowTunes is a gesture based application where people use their shadows to create music using aerial gestures. The application screen, which can be projected to any big flat surface, contains 8 colored bubbles each representing a musical note in ascending clockwise order. Whenever a shadow touches those bubbles the corresponding musical note is played. Users keep touching various bubbles in sequence, using in-air hand gestures, to play different songs. To make it more interative and intersting, we added a feature of changing the shadow's color to the color of the bubble being touched. Users can also sing along while producing music to have more fun. Thus, users get an audio as well as visual entertaining experience with ShadowTunes.  The shadow has a pattern to make it more attarctive and to give it a character.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Envisioned users and context of use
      </h3>
      <p>
        ShadowTunes can be used as a public engagement application at many locations such as  :
        <li>
        Shopping malls - source of entertainment for people who are shopping, standing in check-out queues  
        </li>
        <li>Cafe/Restaurants - people waiting before/after placing orders, people waiting to get in
        </li>
        <li>Classrooms - students would enjoy producing music from their shadows instead of playing an instrument directly.
        </li>
        <li>Dance rooms - people can play music and dance to the tunes
        </li>

        Thus, ShadowTunes can be used as a great public engagement and entertainment app in a variety of public places. People will enjoy making music with ShadowTunes because it is not just another music "Phone app". It requires people to get out of their monotonous life use physical aerial gestures to make music.

        For the demo video, we chose a dance hall where people come weekly and learn "form of dance?". They were very excited to use this ShadowTunes. The fact that they could see their shadown on a big screen and play music with shadows excited them.
