      <p>
        We are targeting 3rd graders at Escondido School during their recess. This is a critical age where some students have become more inhibited while others have not. Two key characteristics of this age are “positive energy” and “unbounded enthusiasm”.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Setting
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Where: We would place a projection screen on the edge of the pavement in the recess area.
        </li>
        <li>
          When: During recess.
        </li>
        <li>
          How many people: We would expect around 60 third-graders, a fraction of which (maybe 10%) who might be interested in our public engagement application.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        Desired features
      </h3>
      <p>
        We would look for an application that is suitable for students with lots of energy and enthusiasm. We would also want something that can allow students to come and go and not have a fixed time required to use the application because third graders may have short attention spans.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Design features
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Fun: Many students enjoy dancing. Other public art examples have shown people like seeing themselves in another reality so our ghost shadows that play on the next repeat of a song will be a chance to see how they or their friends danced a few minutes ago. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Overcoming inhibition: We will encourage people to join in dancing and in this way create both a dance hall with real dancers and a rocking dance hall with real dancers and the ghost dancers. We also hope that the presence of ghost dancers will help users start dancing, since we have found that getting students to dance requires a critical mass of dancers dancing first.
        </li>
        <li>
          Flexible engagement time: We allow students to come and go across the screen. We avoid an atmosphere of emptiness by playing recordings of the ghost shadows.
        </li>
      </ul>

        We are targeting MIT undergrads visiting the gym who have a few key interests:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Have fun
        </li>
        <li>
          Make new friends
        </li>
        <li>
          Stay active
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The students are generally 18-22 years old and athletic.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Setting
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Where: In the main lobby of the Z Center gym since it will be warm.
        </li>
        <li>
          When: We would target users 9-11pm when it will be darker but there will be artificial lights.
        </li>
        <li>
          How many people: About 5 or so people walk by the front door per minute.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        Desired features
      </h3>
      <p>
        Students walking by the front of the gym would be inclined to use our public engagement application if it looks fun and if it’s something social (do with new or old friends).

        We are targeting Stanford graduate students living in Rains Houses visiting Sunday SOS on January 18, 2013. These graduate students have a few key interests:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          De-stress
        </li>
        <li>
          Meet potential lover
        </li>
        <li>
          Make new friends
        </li>
        <li>
          Meet up with old friends
        </li>
        <li>
          Have fun
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The students are generally 22-28 years old and coed but primarily male.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Setting
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Where: Each Sunday there are snacks and drinks open to Stanford graduate students living in Rains Houses.
        </li>
        <li>
          When: The SOS runs from 9 to 10pm so it’ll be dark although there are flood lights for extra lighting.
        </li>
        <li>
          How many people: About 50 people attend the happy hour although people generally are reluctant to leave the food so we would likely expect 1-10 people interested in our public engagement application at a time.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        Desired features
      </h3>
      <p>
        Students attending this happy hour would be inclined to use our public engagement application if it looks fun, if it’s something social (do with new or old friends) or if it’s a chance to show off to potential lovers. 
      </p>
      <h3>
        Design features
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Fun: Many students enjoy music and games. We have also seen that the target users enjoy competitions so this might be a chance for users to fulfill some social needs while also sparking their competitive spirit.
        </li>
        <li>
          Social: Similar to traditional DDR, we envision this will be a game that is social as dancing musicians try to do a better job than their friends. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Showing off: Our public engagement application will give a chance for users to show off their moves and musical abilities.
        </li>
      </ul>
